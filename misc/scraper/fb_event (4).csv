We are educators who pledge to work with students to raise campus awareness of the risks posed by climate change. Universities have an opportunity to take the ethical lead in responding to climate emergency and the Arts can stage the declaration symbolically in the performance of a flag raising ceremony.

The Campus March for Climate Emergency at Cornell reinforces the university’s mission to educate the next generation of planetary citizens and its core value of respecting the environment. Action on climate change will require an extraordinary effort from all those concerned with climate, across all student groups on campus. The March proceeds from Ho Plaza to Rand Hall, where a “Climate Emergency” flag raising ceremony will be held. The March is scheduled on Friday September 20 in advance of the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City. 

The flag “Climate Emergency” visualizes the planet’s carbon budget in a series of three concentric circles, the thickness of each of which is proportional to CO2 emissions.  The first circle indicates the 1590 gigatons of CO2 that have been released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels between 1850 and 2018. The second concentric circle represents the 350 gigatons of carbon dioxide allowance before the 2°C benchmark, should the 2010 UN political agreement to limit global temperature be respected. This number corresponds to ten years of CO2 emissions at current consumption rates. The third circle represents the 2,795 gigatons of carbon dioxide from burning the fossil fuel that corporations currently hold in their reserves, and which would result in warming Earth well over 7°C.

🎒WHAT IS THIS TRIP ALL ABOUT?🎒

Challenge yourself on this incredible 6-day trek of Kilimanjaro, the tallest free-standing mountain in the world. Your journey to the ‘Roof of Africa’ will see you follow the Machame Route to the stunning Uhuru Peak, at 19,340ft above sea-level, all the while passing through various climate zones along the way.

This year's Porchfest will take place on Sunday, Sept 22. That's the birthday of Toni Basil, King Sunny Adé, Nick Cave, Andrea Bocelli, Joan Jett and Mystikal. It's also the 15th anniversary of the disappearance of (fictional) Oceanic Airlines flight 815, so performers, feel free to cover Driveshaft's ""You All Everybody"" for extra credit. It's Independence Day in both Bulgaria and Mali. And it's also the actual last day of summer this year, which seems poetic.

In response to your feedback last month, we have decided to keep Aurora Street closed to traffic, and there will be performances there. Cayuga, Tompkins, Hancock and Lincoln streets will be open to traffic, with no performances allowed. We know this is a disappointment for many who have performed on those streets in the past, but some adjustments were necessary this year in order to get our permit approved. You can see the new street closure map at http://www.porchfest.org/porchfest-2019/

Volunteer signups are open now, and due to this year's revamped map, we're going to need a TON of volunteers, so please spread the word to anyone who might be up for spending part of the day helping out.

So mark your calendars, tune your banjos, find some comfortable walking shoes, and we'll see you in September!","· Hosted by Porchfest!"

Democracy, Today: Fake News, Social Networks, and Algorithms

The Internet is increasingly the home of democracy. It is where people turn for civic information, engage in political discourse public and private, and turn to mobilize collectively. The virtual structures of the Internet are, in some ways, quite distinct from what preceded; and in other ways, they reproduce and amplify those pre-existing patterns. The Internet can be the ultimate disseminator of misinformation; as well as the ultimate educator. People have at their fingertips more diverse sources of information than ever before; yet many of the institutions for the production of political and civic information are being eviscerated. This talk will discuss the informational and social logics of the Internet-- what is our democracy, today?-- how they support and undermine democracy, and concludes with a discussion of what structures and practices we need from the Internet to support democracy, today.

Professor Lazer's research focuses on the nexus of network science, computational social science, and collaborative intelligence. He is the founder of the citizen science website Volunteer Science and the political visualization website VisPolics. His research has been published in such journals as Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the American Political Science Review, and the Administrative Science Quarterly, and has received extensive coverage in the media, including the New York Times, NPR, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and CBS Evening News.

Professor Lazer serves in multiple leadership and editorial positions, including as a board member for the International Network of Social Network Analysts (INSNA), reviewing editor for Science, associate editor of Social Networks and Network Science, numerous other editorial boards and program committees. He was a founder of the Political Networks Section, as well as a founder and founding host of the Political Networks conference.","· Hosted by Cornell Center for Social Sciences and 2 others"
